# HHMC
**Hybrid heuristic for the maximum cut on graphs**

This heuristic algorithm was automatically generated using the [AutoBQP](https://github.com/souzamarcelo/AutoBQP) solver. The automated algorithm design process and the HHMC algorithm are detailed in the following article (see AAC_M algorithm).
